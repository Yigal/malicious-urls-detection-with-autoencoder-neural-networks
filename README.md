# Malicious URLs detection with autoencoder neural network
This repository contains the code source of Detecting malicious URLs using an autoencoder neural network. 
An article descrbing how it works are available at

To build and test a model you can run:
$ python train_and_test_urls_autoencoder.py

If you want to generated new enriched data you can run:
$ python enrich_urls_data.py
